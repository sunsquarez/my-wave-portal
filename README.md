# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which allows sending a message that will be stored on that contract.

✅ Storing messages from users on the blockchain
✅ Fund contract, set a prize, and send users Ethereum
✅ Randomly pick a winner and prevent spammers
